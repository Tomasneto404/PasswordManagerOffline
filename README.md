# Password Manager Offline

## Instructions
Run the main.py file once. A message with instructions will be printed.
In the main.py file there will be a function named first_start(). <br>
The fuction will print a new personal secret key that you must save (**copy only what is between the quotes**. Ex: b' ___secretkey___ ' ). <br>
That key is crucial for the password manager. Once lost is impossible to recover the data encrypted. <br>
After getting the key you can toggle the comment line or simply delete the line.

This program is designed to be carried around in a pen drive for example. It's not very pratical but like everything in life, the more secure something is
the more inconvenient it is to use.
